## Word Wrap Kata

Create a function which breaks words on specified space with new line. Its nothing but merely similar to word-processor.

#### Steps

* Create a public class named WordWrap
* Create a method 'wrap' it can be a static method
* Create a function which count the number of splitter words of non-space
* check for if words already having newline ['\n'] characters - ignore in counts
* Check for multiple lines
* Remove blank spaces if any in new line eg. Actual - "this is a test" WrappedText = "this\n is a t\nest"
