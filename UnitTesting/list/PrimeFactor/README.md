## PrimeComposite Kata

Write a program that prints numbers within specified range lets say 1 to 100.
If number is <em>prime</em> print 'prime' instead of the number.
If number is <em>composite</em> but not <em>even</em> print 'composite' instead of number.
Else print number.

### Steps

* Prints numbers from 1 to 100.
* Print "Prime" instead of number, if the number is prime, means <em>number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself</em>.
* Print "Composite" instead of number, if the number is composite, means <em>number has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. In other words, a composite number is any integer greater than one that is not a prime number</em> but not a <em>even number</em>.
* An even number is <em>an integer is even if it is 'evenly divisible' by two</em>.
* Print number, if it does not meet above two conditions.
* Make method to accept any number of range [currently  we have 1 to 100].
* Create a new method to check Prime/Composite of a single supplied method.
