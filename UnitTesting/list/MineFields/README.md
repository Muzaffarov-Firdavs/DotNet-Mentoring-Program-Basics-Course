## Mine Fields Kata

A field of N x M squares is represented by N lines of
exactly M characters each. The character '*' represents
a mine and the character '.' represents no-mine.

Example input (a 4 x 3 mine-field of 12 squares, 2 of
which are mines)

	4 3
	*...
	..*.
	....

Your task is to write a program to accept this input and
produce as output a hint-field of identical dimensions
where each square is a * for a mine or the number of
adjacent mine-squares if the square does not contain a mine.

Example output (for the above input)

	*211
	12*1
	0111
